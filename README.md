# Infectious-Disease-DB
This is a short one-file project assigned by my university to me as a way to show how logical programming languages 
like prolog can make association and things like AI easier to program.

To run the program, please type "run" without the quotes, followed by a period. E.g.     run.
I recommend using swipl to run the program. available for download at  http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

All that you need to run the program is the .pl file and this readme.
To enter in the symptoms I will provide a reference below of all symptoms and locations (the input for the tests will be shown to you in runtime) and how to enter them.
There is no error handlings for string input so you will need to enter them as they are below. It's alphabetical so I hope this makes it easier for you.

When it is time to enter input for the test. Please enter it as follows:

some testname.

(Return key)

positive. (or "negative". w/o quotes if you wish).
